def generate_thinking_prompt(question, actions, backstory, agent_scratchpad):
    prompt = f"""
    You are a helpful assistant with the following backstory:
    {backstory}

    Answer the following question as best you can:
    {question}

    You have access to the following tools:
    {[action.get_tool_info() for action in actions]}

    The way you use the tools is by specifying a JSON blob.
    Specifically, this JSON should have a `name` key (with the name of the tool to use), and an `arguments` key (which contains an object with the required inputs for the tool).

    The only values that should be in the "name" field are: {', '.join([action.__name__ for action in actions])}

    Additionally, for each tool, you must provide the `module` where the tool is located in the `arguments` field. This is essential for the execution context.

    The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Below is a detailed example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

    ```json
    {{
        "name": "<ToolName>",
        "arguments": {{
            "query": "<Input query>",
            "type": "<Input type>",
            "module": "<Full module path of the tool>"
        }}
    }}
    ```

    Example of $JSON_BLOB for the "WikiSearch" tool:
    ```json
    {{
        "name": "WikiSearch",
        "arguments": {{
            "query": "What is the capital of France?",
            "type": "str",
            "module": "automind.actions.tools.wikisearch"
        }}
    }}
    ```

    Example of $JSON_BLOB for the "Calculator" tool:
    ```json
    {{
        "name": "Calculator",
        "arguments": {{
            "query": "5 + 3",
            "type": "str",
            "module": "automind.actions.tools.calculator"
        }}
    }}
    ```

    ALWAYS use the following format:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action:
    $JSON_BLOB
    Observation: the result of the action
    ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
    Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.

    This is your previous work:
