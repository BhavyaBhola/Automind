# Automind

Automind is an autonomous agent library designed for performing various tasks such as information retrieval and complex decision-making using large language models (LLMs). Automind provides easy-to-use, configurable agents that can be customized with different tools and LLMs.

## Installation

To install Automind, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automind.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd automind

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed in your environment.

## Usage

Automind provides different types of agents for handling various types of tasks. Below are some examples to help you get started:

### SingleAgent

The `SingleAgent` is useful for simpler tasks like information retrieval.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from automind.agents.SingleAgent import SingleAgent
from automind.actions.tools.duckduckgosearch import DuckDuckGoSearch
from automind.actions.tools.wikisearch import WikiSearch
from automind.llms.gemini import Gemini_model

def main():
    configs = {
        "google_api_key": "<Your_api_key>",
        "temperature": 0.4
    }

    llm = Gemini_model(gemini_model_name="gemini-1.5-flash", configs=configs)

    test_exe = SingleAgent(
        question="Latest Geopolitical News",
        llm=llm,
        summary=True,
        actions=[DuckDuckGoSearch, WikiSearch],
        backstory='You are an expert researcher who is able to extract the relevant information'
    )
    res = test_exe.run()
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

#output -->

"""
- **Title:** Geopolitics Politics, Relations & Current Affairs - Foreign Policy
- **Link:** https://foreignpolicy.com/tag/geopolitics/
- **Summary:**  Provides weekly news, analysis, and data on geopolitical developments, including a focus on the shift in power dynamics between Europe and Asia. 

- **Title:** Geopolitics - Financial Times
- **Link:** https://www.ft.com/geopolitics
- **Summary:** Offers comprehensive coverage of global geopolitical developments, including news, analysis, and opinion on politics and international relations.

### ThinkAgent

The `ThinkAgent` uses the reaction and action paradigm and is useful for more complex tasks requiring multiple iterations.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from automind.agents.ThinkAgent import ThinkAgent
from automind.actions.tools.duckduckgosearch import DuckDuckGoSearch
from automind.actions.tools.wikisearch import WikiSearch
from automind.llms.gemini import Gemini_model

def main():
    configs = {
        "google_api_key": "<Your_api_key>",
        "temperature": 0.4
    }

    llm = Gemini_model(gemini_model_name="gemini-1.5-flash", configs=configs)

    test_exe = ThinkAgent(
        question="Plan a detailed 3 day trip to Rajasthan, India",
        llm=llm,
        num_iterations=2,
        actions=[DuckDuckGoSearch, WikiSearch],
        backstory='You are an expert researcher who is able to extract the relevant information'
    )
    res = test_exe.run()
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

#output-->

==============================
ðŸŽ¯ Final Answer:
 Based on my research, a 3-day trip to Rajasthan could include:
Day 1: Arrive in Jaipur, the capital city, and explore the iconic Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds), and the City Palace. Stay overnight in a heritage hotel for a truly authentic experience.
Day 2: Take a day trip to the beautiful city of Udaipur, known as the "Venice of the East". Visit the City Palace, Lake Pichola, and Jag Mandir. Enjoy a boat ride on the lake and stay overnight in a lakeside resort.
Day 3: Travel to Jodhpur, the "Blue City", and explore the Mehrangarh Fort, Jaswant Thada, and the bustling markets. Stay overnight in a traditional haveli (mansion) for a unique cultural experience.

Transportation: 
- You can travel between cities by train, bus, or car. 
- For shorter distances, consider using taxis, auto-rickshaws, or even camels.

Accommodation:
- Rajasthan offers a wide range of accommodation options, from budget-friendly guesthouses and homestays to luxurious palaces and forts. 
- Heritage hotels and havelis are popular choices for their unique charm and historical significance.

Remember to book your accommodation and transportation in advance, especially during peak season. Enjoy your trip to Rajasthan!

## Creating Custom Action Tools

You can create your own custom action tools in Automind by inheriting from the `BaseAction` class and implementing the `execute` method.

### Example of Creating a Custom Action Tool

To create a custom action tool, you need to inherit from `BaseAction` and implement the `execute` method:

```python
from automind.actions.base import BaseAction

class CustomAction(BaseAction):

    def execute(self):
        # Custom logic for the action
        result = "Executed custom action."
        return result
```

This allows you to extend the capabilities of Automind by defining your own tools that perform specific actions based on your requirements.
